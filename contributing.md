### Naming Scheme

### Versioning Scheme
We use `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0` which you can learn more about [here](https://semver.org/) on their website.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
